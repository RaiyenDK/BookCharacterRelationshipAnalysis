# Book Character Network Relationship Analysis

In this project, I conduct a network analysis to explore the relationships between characters in the Witcher series book. With the help of experts on Youtube and leveraging data science techniques and network theory, I construct a character interaction network, apply key metrics to identify central figures and employ visualization to represent the character dynamics intuitively. Through sentiment analysis and community detection, I gain valuable insights into the intricate connections among the characters. Tools such as Python and network analysis libraries will be employed to achieve these objectives.
